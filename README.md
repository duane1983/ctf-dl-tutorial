# CTF Workshop Tutorial

This repository contains datasets and code that you can use in the tutorial. Here's the outline of the tutorial

# Outline
* To be updated *

### Part 1: Introduction to Deep Learning (Joe Bakarji)
- Introduction to Deep Learning
- Introduction to TensorFlow (or PyTorch?)
    - Sequential vs. Functional syntax
    - Visualizing layers (might introduce later)
    - Saving model while training
    - Regularization (motivate pruning)

- Examples:
    - Approximate diffusion equation solution: u(x, t)
    - Approximate Takensâ€™ diffeomorphism for Lorenz system
        - Introduce time-delay embedding
        - Build Hankel matrix (code)
        - Optimize network
    - Make predictions of Lorenz in time xi+1=f(xi) with a fully connected network (Motivate RNNs; LSTM etc.)

### Part 2: Pruning  (Olivia Thomas)

### Part 3: Recurrent Neural Networks (Jan Williams)

### Part 4: Hackathon Description
